		<h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p> This document has some information on Quran, Muslims and the prophet of Islam. There is also some related information you might find interesting.</p>

    <p> As Muslims we rely for our source of knowledge on the Quran.  All matters are referred to the Quran and the Sunnah (the way of life practiced by the prophet (pbuh)) </p>

    <p> So how can we say that the Quran is authentic?  The Quran has been memorised and handed over from generation to generation from the time of the prophet till now. So the words in the Quran has been preserved orally.</p> 

    <p>We also have written proof in the existence of oldest copy of the Quran dated 19 years after the prophet passed away.  Immense scholarship in studying every aspect of the Quran has continued to this day.  </p>

    <p>In the words of Dr. Maurice Bucaille, a French  and author of the book “The Bible, The Qur’an and Science, The Holy Scriptures Examined In The Light Of Modern Knowledge.”
    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">   <p>  “The Quran follows on from the two Revelations that preceded it,  and it  is not only free from contradictions in its narrations, but provides a quality all of its own for those who examine it objectively and in the light of science, i.e. its complete agreement with modern scientific data.</p>

    <p>What is more, statements are to be found in it (as has been shown) that are connected with science: and yet it is unthinkable that a man of Muhammad’s time could have been the author of them.</p>

   <p> Modern scientific knowledge therefore allows us to understand certain verses of the Quran which, until now, it has been impossible to interpret.”</p>
</blockquote> 

		<p>There are other proofs I will touch on later.</p>

	<article id="article2">
		<h1>The Quran as a masterpiece of Arabic Literature</h1>
		<p>Those who understand Arabic say the literal beauty of the Quran, is unsurpassed by any other Arabic literature. </p>
    
		<p> Some people say the Quran was created by the prophet (pbuh). The Quran could not have been written by a human, specially someone who could not read or write. Being literate was a skill not many possessed in those days. </p>

    <p>The Quran challenges anyone to produce a chapter like the Quran, to prove that this is not written by a human, to this day that challenge has not been met. </p>
  
    <p> The overwhelming evidence  shows that the Quran is a divinely inspired message sent down by Allah to mankind to guide mankind to the successful way of life both in this world and the hereafter. </p>

	</article>
	
	<article id="article3">
		<h1>Some notes on the Quran</h1>
    <h4> The structure of the Quran </h4>
    <p> The Muslims consider the Quran as a continuation of the scriptures that came before it, the Torah, Psalms, books sent to Moses and Jesus.  We also believe that the Quran is the final and last Testament to mankind. </p>
    
    <p> Unlike a conventional book divided into chapters one following the other, the chapters in the Quran are each a theme, they are connected but arecomplete and unique within itself.  The names does not necessary indicate the contents of this theme. Some chapters like say, Suratul Maryam is the story about Mary (pbuh), the mother of Jesus (pbuh) and also includes the story of Abraham (pbuh) and other prophets (pbut) when it relates  to the theme of that chapter. The story of Mary (pbuh) is also in other chapters where it relates to the theme of that chapter. </p> 


		<p>The Quran begins with the Fatihah, opening chapter, the short chapter of seven verses that captures the relationship of humans and Allah,(God).</p>

		<p>The second Chapter begins with the words to the seekers of truth. It describes who will benefit and gain the guidance of the Quran and those who will not. The rest of the chapter, contains many stories about prophets found in the bible. It's important to remember that the Quran was revealed to the prophet (pbuh) by the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The existing Quran is not arranged in chronological order as it was revealed. The final order was revealed to the prophet (pbuh) and he was told the order that the chapters and verses should be arranged. There are one hundred and fourteen chapters in the Quran. </p>
	  <p>The Quran can be roughly divided into two types of revelation, the revelations that came to the prophet in Mecca, the early years of his prophethood, and the revelations that came in Medina called Meccan and Medinite surahs respectively.</p>

		<p>The significance of this division is, Meccan Surahs teach the people about the nature of Allah. That he is one, and not many. These early teachings are about the existence of Allah and the nature of his relationship with his creation and the ethics that deal with our relations to each other. This is known as Aqeedah, correct belief.</p>

		<p>The Medinite surahs were revealed after the prophets migration to Medina, where he began to establish a religion and a state. This part of the Quran contains the rules and regulations and the dealings with our neighbours and other states. As at this time he was in conflict with the idolators, the rules of war were also revealed to the prophet (pbuh). </p>

    <p> So when learning about Islam it's important to first gain correct understanding of the nature of Allah. Once having understood the nature of Allah you can never despair of the mercy of Allah. </p>
    <p>
    Only then are the laws and rituals taught, to understand what Allah expects of us to lead a good life. </p>

		<h1>Some peoples attitude towards Islam</h1>
		<p> Modern day geopolitics is based on oil. The Middle-East invasion and the related war propaganda also influences the attitudes towards Muslims and Islam. The collective consciousness is that Islam is a backward religion and that the people are violent unreasonable and extreme.</p>

		<p>Despite some people holding this opinion, the reality is Islam is the fastest growing religion for many reasons. To quote some great western  thinkers, whose views of Islam are worth reading as it negates the impression of the collective consciousness. This can be found <a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/134497/what-western-thinkers-said-about-islam"> here. </a></p>

<p>In the above online article I would like to bring to your attention the following quote:  </p>
<blockquote class="highlighted-quote"> <p>“History makes it clear, however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that historians have over repeated.” 
     <p>- (De Lacy O’Leary, Islam at the Crossroads, London, 1923, p.8)</p> </blockquote>

  <article id="article5">
		<h1>What the Quran says about the proof of the existence of God </h1>
    <h4> Existence of the creation. </h4>
		<p> In order to prove the existence of a supreme being, the Quran asks you to look around you, in the world and in the Cosmos, ponder on the creation of man, and other creatures that live in there.</p>
    <p> The alternation of the night and the day, how the celestial bodies , move around each other in orbit, in a cyclic regularity, without a single flaw. The sky is held up without pillars. <strong>Who designed this?</strong>
    </p>
    <p> Secular Scientists previously attributed this to evolution, now more and more scientists now believe that the complexity of the universe cannot be explained by a theory of evolution. These Scientists now believe in the existence of a God. </p>


    <h4> Some proofs in the Quran </h4>
		 <p>1. <a href="http://www.Quranmiracles.com/2011/10/man-created-from-dust-and-water/">Man created from Dust and Water</a> </p>
     <p>In the above online article I would like to bring to your attention the following quote:  </p>
     <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
       <p>"The Quran is exact in its statements. Creating a living being such as man from such ordinary matter is one of the manifestations of the omniscience of Allah. Careful combination in due proportion of all the constituents of the human body demonstrates Allah’s matchless design.</p>
      <p> The creation of man, a masterpiece, out of a matter of simple aspect like clay, shows again the greatness of Allah."</p> </blockquote>
     
     <p> It must be remembered that these verses, (Holy Quran:21:30), were revealed in the 6th Century. No scientific equipment to prove that existed. This was at a time when Europe was in the Dark Ages.</p> 
		 <p>2. <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/creation-of-the-universe-2004201">Creation of the Universe</a></p>
	   <blockquote class="highlighted-quote"> In this webpage quotations from the Quran interspersed with Scientific discoveries only discovered in this and the last century. Matters such as "Big Bang", expansion of the universe, the six day epoch of creation are discussed.</blockquote>	
		<p> Also the scientific facts contained in the Quran were not known 1400 years ago. Science is incomplete in it's knowledge and is in a state of flux. The facts in the Quran are compatible with the reality of the human condition. We are born, we live and we die. The Quran pays attention to each of these phases of our existence with clarity and wisdom.</p>
    <p>3.  <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A10606.0001.001/1:4.2?rgn=div2;view=fulltext">Amazing fact about the Creation of Bees</a></p>  
	    </p>
    <p> There is a revelation of the role of bees and how they were created. This is found in (Holy Quran 16:68 to 69). The most amazing aspect of this is the bees are described using the feminine tense. The Worker bee are indeed feminine and the male exists only to sleep, eat and procreate. The link above gives details. This fact was discovered only in 1637 by Richard Remnant, the information is in Old English, but still easy to read from the link above. 1400 years ago only the creator of these bees could have known they were feminine.</p>

    <p>4. <a href="https://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/understanding-islam/why-was-pharaohs-body-preserved/ ">Why was Pharaoh’s Body Preserved?</a></p>
    <p>  Pharaoh's  body was discovered only in the 19th Century . His body was found intact. This was a fact stated in the Quran (Holy Quran 10:92). In the article above I would like to bring to your attention this quotation from Dr.Maurice Bucaille.</p>
    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote"> <p>The body of the Pharaoh was only discovered in 1898 but the Quran was revealed nearly 1400 years ago.</p>
     <p> It is almost impossible for a man (Muhammed) to say accurately how a certain thing happened in the ancient past and make a connection with that thing to predict how it would be in the future.</p>
     <p> So it's clear that the verses from the Quran is nothing but the words of Allah</p>

		<h1>How the Quran contributed to change a nomadic society to an advanced society </h1>
		<p>This awareness and reflection, resulted in a civilization that was then a super-power and highly advanced.</p>
		<p>The Arabs were scientists of their day and their discoveries and inventions are still in use today. The Quran's command to look around them made them explore the world contributing to the progress of modern civilization.</p>

    <p> An excerpt from above webpage </p>
    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
    <p>The sources of the Enlightenment are not simply in Greece and Rome.</p>
    <p>Civilisation is always being reinvented. The civilisation some call “Western” has been, and still is, continually shaped by a wide range of political, literary and intellectual influences, all worthy of our attention"</p>

    <p> Further information on the development and discoveries by the early arabs, in the fields of Trignometry, Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, Mechanics, Optics and Geography</p>
    
		3. <a href="https://blog.globalacademyjobs.com/the-worlds-first-university-was-founded-by-a-woman/">First Universities and centers of learning</a>
		<p>Learning and scientific investigation was held in such high priority that the centres of learning and Universities were first started in Muslim countries.</p>
 
		<p> All these advancement was possible, because they practiced a code of ethics which emphasised justice to all, nobody was superior to another except by his piety to Allah. Discipline, purity, caring of parents and elders, tithing and community building, good relations with neighbours and neighbour states, spreading the peace, greeting each other with salutations of peace and an creating a very caring advanced society. The equal opportunities available to all resulted in contributions that benefited the entire society.</p>

		<p> At that time some countries voluntarily surrendered to the armies of the Muslims, as they knew that they would be ruled by the just laws in the Quran and not by despotic rulers. Unfortunately however in later times the Muslim rulers strayed away from the teachings of the Quran and became despotic rulers and did not rule by the laws in the Quran and hence the decline and fall of Muslim rulers.</p>

	<article id="article8">
		<h1>Guidance for dealing with the realities of life on a daily basis </h1>
    <h4> The reality of our existence </h4>
    <p> The reality of our existence is we are born, we live our life span and then we die. This reality is important to remember everyday. What tends to happen with all of us is although we know this to be true, we park this realisation in a place at the back of our minds and sometimes we act as if we have all of eternity to do the things we want to do.</p>

     </p>
   
     <p> Allah has gifted us with mechanisms to help us to survive. When the body needs replenishment we feel hungry. When we fear a danger adrenaline is pumped into the body to help us to cope. Every single mechanisms to survive we have been gifted with.  
     </p>
     <p> What is the equivalent gift for the soul. The soul reaches for purity and when it touches purity it comforted. It continues to to reach out, and the default of mankind is to be good. </p>
     
    </p>

    <p> The other reality is whether we accept it or not all indications from every religion shows that a divine hand controls our lives. We have but only limited self-will to control the affairs in our lives. This world is only a fleeting instance in the eternity of time. </p>
    
    <h4> Worship is for our benefit  </h4>
    <p> Allah does not need our worship, we need Allahs guidance in big things and in small things. Once you believe in Allah, and agree to obey his commands your life changes. </p>

    <p> It does not mean that you will not be tested, life is created with struggle as this struggle is necessary for progress. With belief your attitude to life changes. Whatever happens to you, you know it is Allahs will and you put your trust in him. He has promised that he is your protector. Your frame of reference is not a lifetime, its an eternity. You desire the good of this world and the hereafter. Any discomfort even a pin prick will be compensated. You are grateful for everything. The common Islamic expression is "Alhamdulila" it's connotation is  gratefulness for the blessing mixed with proclaiming praise to the giver of the blessing. There is scientific evidence to prove that everybody's happiness depends on the level of gratitude in their life. You can read about it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2021/04/25/gratitude-is-a-key-to-happiness-4-reasons-why/?sh=148cf435347c">here.</a></p>     

    <h4> The reality of the prophets existence     </h4>
		<p>When you study the life of the prophet (pbuh), you will realise that his test was far harder than anything we will ever go through. Some of these tests and trials he faced like the persecution in Mecca, the disastrous visit to Taif where he was stoned and chased away by the people. Yet his faith in Allah was unwavering and his focus on his mission fixed.  Not all his prayers were immediately answered. In some cases it was delayed and sometimes it was not granted, yet he accepted Allah's will and his faith never wavered.</p>

    <h4> Our relationship to God   </h4>
		<p>We are asked to seek Allahs help with prayer and  with patience as Allah is always with those who are patient. We have no one else worth worshipping and only he is our helper.</p>
 
    <p> The positive approach to Islam is to see how actions earn rewards. Not to look at how sins earn punishments. We were created weak and so our sincere repentance is accepted by the most forgiving and most merciful.</p>

<p>For example in the Quran we are asked to "... Eat and drink, but waste not ..". We are rewarded every time you eat and drink without wasting food. How easy is that to earn rewards.. </p>

<p> The sin Allah does not like is associating partners with him. He forgives those who repent because he is the most forgiving the most merciful.  </p>


    <p> We can guide our lives by retrospection. We acknowledge what we do wrong. There are no intermediaries between Allah and the believer. Allah is the most merciful, most compassionate and most forgivng. He says his mercy exceeds his wrath. No one needs despair of his forgiveness. </p> 


    <h4> Some sayings of our prophet (pbuh)   </h4>
    <p>  The prophet (pbuh) was given comprehensiveness in speech. Some of his sayings are:
         <ul> 
           <li>In Islam, the golden rule, which is found in all religions is phrased as "Not one of you truly believes until you wish for others what you wish for yourself".</li>
           <li>The rights of Allah is that you worship him, and the rights of the believer is that he will not punish you. </li>
           <li>Fear the prohibitions, and you'll be the greatest of worshippers.</li>
           <li>Be pleased with what Allah has allotted as a portion for you and you will be the be the wealthiest of people. </li> 
           <li>A man asked “Which act in Islam is the best?” He (pbuh) replied, “To give food, and to greet everyone, whether you know or you do not know".</li> 


   </ul>

       
      
    <h4> Where can one get further information about Islam  </h4>
    <ul>
    <p> There are many sources where you can get further information about Islam. Here are a few:</p>
       <p> <b><em>Islamic websites:</em></b> There are many Islamic websites that provide information about Islam. Some popular ones include <a href="https://IslamicFinder.org">IslamicFinder.org</a>  and <a href="https://AboutIslam.net">AboutIslam.net</a> .</p>

       <p><b><em>Muslim community centers and mosques:</em></b> Local Muslim community centers and mosques may organize programs or events related to Islamic matters, where you can learn more.</p>
